# Health Insurance Cost Prediction App

An interactive machine learning web app that predicts a person’s health insurance cost based on input features like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
The model was trained using Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) and deployed with Streamlit Cloud for real-time predictions.

## Live Demo

## Features
 • Predicts insurance cost in real-time

 • Powered by Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)

 • Handles categorical variables with pd.get_dummies()

 • Loads pre-trained model with Joblib

 • Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface


## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the app locally or on Streamlit Cloud.

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/HayTyrant/Health-Insurance-Charge
cd health-insurance-charge

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app locally

streamlit run app.py



## Deploying on Streamlit Cloud
 1. Push your project to a GitHub repository.
 2. Visit Streamlit Cloud. (https://streamlit.io/cloud)
 3. Click “New App” → Connect your GitHub account.
 4. Select your repo and branch.
 5. In “Main file path,” enter:
 app.py
 6. Streamlit Cloud will automatically install dependencies from requirements.txt.

### Requirements: Ensure the following files are in your repo root:

 • app.py

 • gbr_model.pkl

 • model_columns.pkl

 • requirements.txt

 • README.md


## How It Works
 1. User inputs age, sex, BMI, number of children, region, and smoker status.
 2. Input data is converted to a DataFrame and encoded using get_dummies().
 3. The new data is reindexed to match the model’s training columns.
 4. The pre-trained GBR model predicts the insurance cost.
 5. Streamlit displays the prediction dynamically.

## Model Performance

Metric Value
R² Score 0.84
MAE 2494.94

The model was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robust performance across unseen data.
